	<description>Adds the slug race from Faster Than Light.
1 race :
	- Slug, 
The xenophobic, leisurely Slugs are the third rarest race in the galaxy, behind the mythical Crystal and Lanius. Their home sectors are all engulfed in enormous nebulae, which lead to them evolving unique psychic abilities in order to overcome the general lack of visibility.

As a result, Slug ships aren't built with sensors; the psychic powers of the crew are just as effective, if not more so, than any electronic system. This leaves them at a distinct disadvantage outside nebulae however, so that even within their sectors they are almost never seen outside the concealing clouds.
	
While not as aggressive as the Rockmen or the Mantis, Slugs are both greedy and deceitful. They prey upon ships that wander into their home systems, often leading them into traps, as well as resort to piracy in other systems.
